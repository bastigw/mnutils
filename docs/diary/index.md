# A dev diary for MNUtils

Sooner or later you will stumble upon a line of MNUtils code and wonder *why on earth is this
designed this way*. The code shows you *what* it does; it almost never shows you the argument that
produced it. That argument is what this diary aims to keep.

So if you are chasing the reasoning behind a design decision, you are in the right place! Skim the
entries below, or search for the thing that puzzled you. Each entry is one decision, told as a
story — and when a decision evolves, its entry is rewritten in place rather than joined by a
sequel. The muted *Last edited* line under each title tells you the story is current.

## How an entry gets written

The entries are a by-product of how MNUtils is actually built. A significant change usually starts
as a planning session — nowadays often with e.g. Claude Code — that ends in a precise, ordered
plan. That plan is exactly right for *doing* the work and sometimes not so good for *judging* it:
several mechanical steps with the one real decision buried underneath them.

So before any code is written, the plan is distilled into a short **draft entry** — one screen:
the tension, the decision, a diagram, and often a code snippet or two — a small user story
sketching the call we wish existed. That draft is what gets reviewed — and the work stops until it
has been. Writing it this early, forcing the argument onto a single page, helps catch a bad
decision early.

Then the work happens, and reality argues back. So once the change lands, the draft is
**reconciled into the story you are reading**: corrections wherever the plan turned out wrong, the
real file paths and code snippets dropped in so you can see how it works under the hood, and a
straight account of why — having now built it — we think the call was right.

Writing one yourself? [Write a dev-diary entry](#contribute-dev-diary) has the
mechanics, straight from the skill that drives it.
