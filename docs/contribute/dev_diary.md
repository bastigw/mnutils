# Write a dev-diary entry

A [dev-diary entry](#diary-about) records *why* a significant change was made — the kind of
decision someone will want explained when they ask "why is it like this?" a year from now. You
write it twice: a short draft distilled from the approved plan — the thing actually reviewed
*before* the work starts, and the work waits until it has been — and a final version reconciled
once the change has landed, rewritten into the story of how it is now.

Not every change earns one. Choosing between two viable approaches, adding conceptual surface (a
rule, a module boundary, a namespace), or a refactor that spans several PRs does; a bug fix, a
routine dependency bump, or a function that follows an existing pattern does not. The skill always
puts that call to you before writing anything — and when an existing entry already tells the
decision's story, it proposes updating that entry instead of adding a sibling.

Entries live under `docs/diary/`, below the pinned [intro](#diary-about), with the newest at the
bottom. The mechanics — the two passes, the one-screen budget, and how open assumptions are marked
so they *render* on the page you review — are exactly what the skill enforces:
