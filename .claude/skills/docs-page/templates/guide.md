# Guide — `docs/contribute/`

Procedural pages for people working *on* MNUtils rather than *with* it: setup, the contributing
walkthrough, releasing.

**This is the one genre exempt from the motivated-narrative rule.** A guide's reader has already
decided to do the thing and wants the steps. `setup.md` should be a numbered list of commands;
novelizing it makes it worse. Everything else in `CLAUDE.md` § "Documentation style" still binds —
one home per concept, stands alone, the palette carries the argument.

## Skeleton

Frontmatter only if the page needs live cells. When you do add it, the kernel label is still
exactly `Python 3 (mnutils)`.

## Rules specific to this genre

- **Commands must be copy-pasteable and current.** Package manager is `uv`, never pip. Verify
  every command actually runs before committing — a guide is judged entirely on whether its steps
  work.
- **Point at the canonical source instead of restating it.** If a rule lives in `CLAUDE.md` or
  another guide, link it — duplicated rules drift; a pointer cannot.
- **Say what a step is for.** One clause of motivation per step is not narrative, it is the
  difference between a runnable list and a cargo cult.
- A troubleshooting table beats scattered warnings — it is the shape a reader scans when stuck.

## Register

TOC group is **Contribute**, kept last in `docs/myst.yml`. These pages are also the ones most
likely to be read raw on GitHub/GitLab rather than on the site, so keep them legible unrendered:
no reliance on a directive to carry essential meaning.
